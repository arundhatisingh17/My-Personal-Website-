    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
    <p>
        Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal webpage. My name is Arundhati Singh, and I am presently a rising junior at the 
        University of Wiscosnin-Madison majoring in Computer Sciences and Data Sciences with a certificate in Mathematics. As a Computer Sciences and Data Sciences major
        with a passion for innovation and problem solving, I like to constantly explore porject ideas that can make a posiitve impact. One potential
        project that I am currently considering involves developing an app that provides small loans for essential expenses like gas, groceries
        vehicle fuel, and other household bills (electricity, water, rental), based on the user's payment date and wages. This project primarily 
        aims to help individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck and may need a small loan to cover essential expenses before their next paycheck.
        I am really excited about this project to promote financial inclusion and help individuals manage their finances more efficiently. I am also open 
        to collaborating with others on this project, so feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together!
    </p>
