    <p class = "description">Hi! Thank you for taking the time to visit my page!

        My name is Arundhati Singh, and I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I am studying Computer Sciences and Data Sciences with a Mathematics Certificate. I have a strong passion for technology and enjoy exploring new concepts in the field. Outside of academics, I am an avid music lover and enjoy singing in my free time.
        
        I am always eager to learn and grow, and I welcome any opportunities for connection or collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to connect!
