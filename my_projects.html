                        resulting in enhanced user satisfaction and retention rates.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>MindWI: Mental Health Analysis (Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, Git, HTML)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spearheaded MindWI, cleaning, sorting, and integrating diverse mental health datasets from Wisconsin
                        and Milwaukee.</li>
                    <li>Employed advanced statistical analysis techniques to uncover trends and correlations, utilizing tools such
                        as Pandas and Matplotlib for insightful data visualization. </li>
                    <li>Leveraged spatial analysis tools including Folium and GeoPandas to create informative maps, empowering
                        stakeholders with actionable insights into mental health trends.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CulinaryCompass (Python, mySQL, Web Scraping, DBMS, ReactJS, Flask, Beautiful Soup)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed and deployed a web application powered by Flask to allow users to explore and discover new
